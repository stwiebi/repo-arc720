# Architecture Glossary

This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key concepts related to software architecture and APIs.

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with a software component or service.

### API Client
Any application that invokes the API.

## C

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services (e.g., servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet, often through a pay-as-you-go model. It allows organizations to scale and manage their resources more efficiently.

## D

### Deployment
Deployment is the process of making a software application or system available for use. It involves installing, configuring, and releasing a software product to a specific environment or platform.

### Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help architects and developers create more maintainable and scalable software by following established best practices.

## M

### Microservices
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through APIs. It promotes modularity and allows for easier scaling and maintenance.

## R

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a set of constraints and principles for creating stateless and scalable web services. RESTful APIs are based on these principles.

## S

### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or demands by adding resources or modifying the architecture. It ensures that a system can grow to accommodate more users and data.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural approach that structures an application as a collection of services that can be reused and combined to create complex functionality. SOA promotes loose coupling and reusability.

### Software Architecture
Software architecture refers to the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It defines the components, their relationships, and the principles governing their design. It influences system qualities like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## T

### Testing
Testing is the process of evaluating a software system to identify and correct defects or issues. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are used to ensure the quality and reliability of a software product.

## U

### UML (Unified Modeling Language)
UML is a standardized modeling language used in software engineering to visually represent the architecture, design, and behavior of software systems. It includes diagrams like class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams.
